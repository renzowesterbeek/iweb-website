# Zermelo Notificaties Website (frontend)
[renzo.westerbeek.us/rooster](http://renzo.westerbeek.us/rooster)

Instructions and registration website for my Zermelo Notification Server. All data is sent to the [server backend]("http://git.io/vOzv8") when a user registers. Backend handles registration and push-notifications.

## What is InfoWeb?
_Zermelo is the schedule system my school uses. I'm creating a service that sends notifications to students when their schedule changes._

## Todo
- [x] Create attractive website design
