# Zermelo Notificaties Website (frontend)
Instructions and registration website for my Zermelo Notification Server. All data is sent to the [server backend](http://git.io/vOzv8) when a user registers. Backend handles registration and push-notifications.

## What is Zermelo?
_Zermelo is the schedule system my school uses. I'm creating a service that sends notifications to students when their schedule changes._
